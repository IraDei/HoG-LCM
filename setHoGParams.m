function hog = setHoGParams(bins, rank, cellsz)
%SETHOGPARAMS 此处显示有关此函数的摘要
    % orign HoG struct is learned from standard by 'chrisjmccormick'.
    % bins - The number of bins to use in the histograms.
    % rank, nHC, nVC - 
    %   The number of cells horizontally and vertically.
    %   We force the sliding kernel as square with length of (rank*2+1)
    %   here.
    % cellsz - 
    %   Cell size in pixels (the cells are square), n*n pixels in each cell.
    % 
    % According to dual-layer sliding model given in section 3.2 in
    % Qian2020, we did adaptions based on original one:
    % T - 
    %   central cell of sliding block in which potential targets are
    %   scanned.
    % B - 
    %   non-central cell.
    % P - 
    %   diagonal directed shade blocks contains T alone its edge with diagonal
    %   length equals to ceil of halved diagonal length of whole block.
    %   Single contrast shade block composed of several cells.
    %   Contrast block here are compiled into 'INDEX-INDICATOR' within
    %   manner of cell index in local sampling window.
